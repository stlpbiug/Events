# URL access concepts

URL requests to Power BI contain parameters that are processed by the service. The way in which the service handles URL requests depends on the parameters, parameter prefixes, and types of items that are included in the URL. Paginated report URL functionality is compatible with most browsers and applications that support standard URL addressing.
